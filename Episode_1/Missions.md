## From the Epsiode, you got to know about basics of OOP such as
	1. Classes
	2. Objects
	3. Con/Destructors
	4. Access Specifiers

## Now, Time to explore...

### 1. Choosing the Language
Pick any language you are familiar with: C++ / Java / Python 3

### 2. Creating Classes
1. Create 2 classes - `Bike` and `Car`
2. Specify as many attributes as you want in them
	- `Size`, `Type`, `Cost`, `Mileage`, `NumberOfGears`, `NumberOfSeats`, `MaxSpeed`, `CurrentSpeed`, etc
3. Declare and define methods in the class
	- `changeSpeed`, `applyBrakes`, `turn`, etc

### 3. Creating and Playing with Objects
1. In a main function, create objects of the above classes
2. Try the following
	- Printing the Object directly (better suited if done in `Java`)
		- Check if you can change that format
	- Accessing the attributes directly
		- What is the alternative then?
	- Change the access types in the class and try accessing directly now
	- Try comparing 2 objects (`Bike`-`Bike`, `Car`-`Car`, `Bike`-`Car`)
		- Is it possible?
		- Can you customize it?
	- Try assigning an Object to another
	- Customize the Constructor
	- Try declaring an Object of class 'Bike' inside the Bike class itself. How can you solve the error that pops up?

### 4. Further
1. Say you did the above exercise
	- What are your thoughts?
	- Did you find some props similar to the 2 classes?
	- Was it confusing the include constant data for an object with variable data of the same object?
2. Suggest a better design of the 2 classes in your implementation
	- Maybe create new Classes?
3. Be ready to explore the above questions in Episode 2... üòÅ
